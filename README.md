A simple product for anonymous messages. Contains a couple of functions for users.  

# Al
How it works: 
T9 tips:
   - When the user starts typing the text, the system analyzes the last word
   - If the input consists of numbers (2-9), variants of words according to the T9-algorithm are shown
   - If the input is letter, popular words are offered starting with the entered letters
   - Tips appear under the input field and can be selected by click

Substitution of "и" to "i":
   - When entering the text, all letters "and" are automatically replaced by "i"
   - The cursor position is retained so as not to interfere with the input process 

# Is it Safe? 
Absolutely! Disabled harmful chips and cookies. Fully anonymous chat without tracking jokes.
