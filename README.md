## How It Works

### T9 Tips
- When the user starts typing, the system analyzes the last word.
- If the input consists of numbers (2-9), variants of words according to the T9 algorithm are shown.
- If the input consists of letters, popular words are offered starting with the entered letters.
- Suggestions appear under the input field and can be selected by clicking.

### Substitution of "и" to "i"
- When entering text, all instances of "и" are automatically replaced by "i".
- The cursor position is retained to ensure a smooth input process.
